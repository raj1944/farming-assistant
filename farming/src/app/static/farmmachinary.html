	Many farmers are upset by their inability to fix the new types of high-tech farm equipment.[3] This is due mostly to companies using intellectual property law to prevent farmers from having the legal right to fix their equipment (or gain access to the information to allow them to do it).[4] In October 2015 an exemption was added to the DMCA to allow inspection and modification of the software in cars and other vehicles including agricultural machinery.[5]

The Open Source Agriculture movement counts different initiatives and organizations such as Farm Labs which is a network in Europe,[6] l'Atelier Paysan which is a cooperative to teach farmers in France how to build and repair their tools,[7][8] and Ekylibre which is an open-source company to provide farmers in France with open source software (SaaS) to manage farming operations.[8][9] In the United States, the MIT Media Lab's Open Agriculture Initiative seeks to foster "the creation of an open-source ecosystem of technologies that enable and promote transparency, networked experimentation, education, and hyper-local production".[10] It develops the Personal Food Computer, an educational project to create a "controlled environment agriculture technology platform that uses robotic systems to control and monitor climate, energy, and plant growth inside of a specialized growing chamber". It includes the development of Open Phenom,[11] an open source library with open data sets for climate recipes which link the phenotype response of plants (taste, nutrition) to environmental variables, biological, genetic and resource-related necessary for cultivation (input).[12] Plants with the same genetics can naturally vary in color, size, texture growth rate, yield, flavor and nutrient density according to the environmental conditions in which they are produced.
