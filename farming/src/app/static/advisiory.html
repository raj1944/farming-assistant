	With every new crop or crop variety a farmer faces the challenge of understanding the package of practices associated with the crop. While the yield greatly depends on how religiously a farmer has adhered to the package of practices, many farmers fail to achieve the yield as they struggle understanding and interpreting the proposed best practices.

This project aims to help farmers improve their yield by providing accurate, timely and highly personalized advisory. Through a simple and intuitive user interface (UI) that requires minimal literacy levels, a farmer can provide basic information about the crop under plantation and the start of plantation. Based on these inputs, a crop calendar kicks into place and the farmer begins to receive periodic calls giving him the necessary advisory in the form of audio/video content.
